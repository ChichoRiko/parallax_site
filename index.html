			<h2>What is Urbanization?</h2>
			<p>
				Urbanization (or urbanization) refers to the population shift from rural
				to urban areas, the corresponding decrease in the proportion of people
				living in rural areas, and the ways in which societies adapt to this
				change. It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are
				formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in
				central areas.

			<h2>Urban Growth</h2>
			<p>
				Although the two concepts are sometimes used interchangeably,
				urbanization should be distinguished from urban growth. Urbanization
				refers to the proportion of the total national population living in
				areas classified as urban, whereas urban growth strictly refers to the
				absolute number of people living in those areas. It is predicted that by
				2050 about 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world
				will be urbanized. That is equivalent to approximately 3 billion
				urbanites by 2050, much of which will occur in Africa and Asia. Notably,
				the United Nations has also recently projected that nearly all global
				population growth from 2017 to 2030 will be by cities, with about 1.1
				billion new urbanites over the next 10 years.

			<h2>The Urban Phenomenon.</h2>
			<p>
				Urbanization is not merely a modern phenomenon, but a rapid and historic
				transformation of human social roots on a global scale, whereby
				predominantly rural culture is being rapidly replaced by predominantly
				urban culture. The first major change in settlement patterns was the
				accumulation of hunter-gatherers into villages many thousands of years
				ago. Village culture is characterized by common bloodlines, intimate
				relationships, and communal behavior, whereas urban culture is
				characterized by distant bloodlines, unfamiliar relations, and
				competitive behavior. This unprecedented movement of people is forecast
				to continue and intensify during the next few decades, mushrooming
				cities to sizes unthinkable only a century ago. As a result, the world
				urban population growth curve has up till recently followed a
				quadratic-hyperbolic pattern.
